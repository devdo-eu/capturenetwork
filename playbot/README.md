# What is in here ?
 Here you will find sample bots that can be used as training partners or as a template to create your own bot.  
 It is a good idea to make a copy of the `random_bot` folder, rename the folder so created,  
 and then start working on your own logic for the bot. 

## How to run AI bot... thing?
 To run any of AI bot you need to install keras, tensorflow and some other dependencies from `environment.yml` file.
 
 basically if you are using conda you can just type: 
 
 `conda env create -f environment.yml`
 
 to create virtual environment called `capnet` with all libraries installed.  
To switch to newly created environment type:  

`conda activate capnet`
